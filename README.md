This paper was having all the images in one folder but we were needing images in separate folders Pos, Neg and Neutral. This python code just copies images from one main folder to other 3 sub folders using shutil library of python.
</br>
</br>
All images was categorised and sentiment stored in csv file.
</br>
In this code we are choosing only those images which are having sentiment majority atleast 2 out of 3. 
</br>
<h4>If any image is having equal sentiment score for all categories we are not choosing it.</h4>
